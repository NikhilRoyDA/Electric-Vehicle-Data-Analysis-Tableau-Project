# 🚗 Electric Vehicle Data Analysis – Tableau Dashboard  
*Uncovering the trends that drive the future of EV adoption!*  

---

## 📢 Why This Project?  
Ever wondered how fast **Electric Vehicles (EVs)** are taking over the roads? Which brands are leading the charge? How government incentives impact adoption?  

I was curious too! So, I analyzed a dataset of **150,000+ EVs** and built an **interactive Tableau dashboard** to bring these insights to life. This project isn't just about numbers—it's about telling a story with data.

## 📊 Project Overview  
This project dives deep into **Electric Vehicle (EV) adoption trends**, visualizing key insights using **Tableau**. It answers critical questions such as:  

- **EV Growth Over Time** – How quickly are people shifting to electric?  
- **Top EV Brands & Models** – Is Tesla really the king of EVs?  
- **State-wise EV Distribution** – Which regions are leading in adoption?  
- **CAFV Incentive Eligibility** – Do government policies influence EV adoption?  

I used **business intelligence and data visualization techniques** to transform raw data into a **user-friendly, interactive dashboard.**

## 🏆 Key Insights Uncovered  
✔ **The Rise of EVs:** Over the last decade, EV adoption has surged, especially post-2018.  
✔ **Tesla Dominates:** More than **54% of EVs** belong to Tesla, reinforcing its market leadership.  
✔ **Regional Disparities:** California alone accounts for **150,000+ EVs**, while some states have fewer than 100.  
✔ **Government Incentives Matter, But...** Only **41.81% of EVs qualify** for government incentives, suggesting room for policy improvements.  

These insights are **not just numbers**—they help **automakers, policymakers, and consumers** make better decisions.

## 💡 What I Learned From This Project  
Every data project teaches something new! Here are my biggest takeaways:  

📌 **Data isn’t useful without context.** Numbers need to tell a story!  
📌 **Tableau is powerful, but simple is better.** A cluttered dashboard confuses users.  
📌 **Policy doesn’t always drive behavior.** Many EV owners don’t qualify for incentives.  

This project was an **eye-opener** on how data can shape business and policy decisions.
